The first person to prove that light’s speed was finite, and to determine it numerically, was Ole Roemer, in a series of measurements around the year 1675.",0.0
"Roemer observed Io, one of Jupiter’s moons, over a period of several years.",0.0
"Since Io presumably took the same amount of time to complete each orbit of Jupiter, it could be thought of as a very distant, very accurate clock.",0.0
"A practical and accurate pendulum clock had recently been invented, so Roemer could check whether the ratio of the two clocks’ cycles, about 42.5 hours to 1 orbit, stayed exactly constant or changed a little.",0.0
"Even if the speed of light was finite, you might expect that the result would be only to offset one cycle relative to the other.",0.0
"The earth does not, however, stay at a constant distance from Jupiter and its moons.",0.0
"Roemer did find a variation in the apparent speed of Io’s orbits, which caused Io’s eclipses by Jupiter (the moments when Io passed in front of or behind Jupiter) to occur about 7 minutes early when the earth was closest to Jupiter, and 7 minutes late when it was farthest.",0.0
"Based on these measurements, Roemer estimated the speed of light to be approximately 2x10s m/s, which is in the right ballpark compared to modern measurements of 3x10s m/s.",0.0
Light can travel through a vacuum.,0.0

"Why should a beam of light have anything resembling a “left wheel” and “right wheel?” After all, the mechanical model would predict that a motorcycle would go straight, and a motorcycle seems like a better approximation to a ray of light than a car.",0.743
"A prominent cross appears around the brightest star, and dimmer ones surround the dimmer stars.",0.743
"It doesn’t matter whether the source of the light is hot, like the sun, a flame, or an incandescent light bulb, or cool, like a fluorescent bulb.",0.7506
"Energy from the light beam is momentarily transformed into extra kinetic energy of the electrons, but because the electrons are accelerating the reradiate more light, converting their kinetic energy back into light energy.",0.7506
"(In other words, decide whether making d greater results in a greater value of d or a smaller one.)",0.7506
The proof of this equation is left as an exercise to those readers who are sufficiently brave and motivated.,0.7506

and since the same amount of energy is concentrated in narrower diffraction fringes, each fringe is brighter and easier to see, (d).",0.7579

Economists normally consider free markets to be the natural way of judging the monetary value of something, but social scientists also use questionnaires to gauge the relative value of privileges, disadvantages, or possessions that cannot be bought or sold.",0.7615
You will find that the shortest comfortable eye-mirror distance is much less than the shortest comfortable eye-paper distance.,0.765
"(The old-fashioned method of making mirrors and lenses is by grinding them in grit by hand, and this process automatically tends to produce an almost perfect spherical surface.)",0.7655
"The two angles can be defined either with respect to the normal, like angles B and C in the figure, or with respect to the reflecting surface, like angles A and D. There is a convention of several hundred years’ standing that one measures the angles with respect to the normal, but the rule about equal angles can logically be stated either as B=C or as A=D.",0.7684
So great is the value attached to sight that some have imbued it with mystical aspects.,0.7778
"In a camera, this type of aberration would show up as a fuzziness near the sides of the picture when the center was perfectly focused.",0.7783
"The same is true for all the other fringes as well,





(b) There is a bright central maximum.",0.7783
"We will use the nice simple ray model for most of this book, and with it we can analyze a great many devices and phenomena.",0.7845
"Judging by the distance from one bright wave crest to the next, the wavelength appears to be about 273 or 3/4 as great as the width of the slit.",0.7906
"The reason this is an important example is not that curved mirrors are so important in and of themselves, but that the results we derive for curved bowl-shaped mirrors turn out to be true for a large class of other optical devices, including mirrors that bulge outward rather than inward, and lenses as well.",0.7992
"To see why, consider the mathematical approximation we’ve been making, which is that the depth of the mirror’s curve is small compared to d and d. Since only a flat mirror can satisfy this shallow-mirror condition perfectly, any curved mirror will deviate somewhat from the mathematical behavior we derived by assuming that condition.",0.802
"Often the best plan is to do a ray diagram first, then do a numerical calculation, then check that your numerical results are in reasonable agreement with what you expected from the ray diagram.",0.8126
"Although it is beautiful that the laws concerning the motion of light can be reduced to one simple rule, the principle of least time, it may seem a little spooky to speak as if the ray of light is intelligent, and has carefully planned ahead to find the shortest route to its destination.",0.8126
Isaac Newton loved the atomic theory of matter so much that he searched enthusiastically for evidence that light was also made of tiny particles.,0.8225
"(I did these drawings using illustration software, but if you were doing them by hand, you’d also want to make much larger ones for greater accuracy.)",0.8402
"Perhaps it shouldn’t surprise us, then, that Newton succeeded so well in explaining the motion of objects, but was far less successful with the study of light.",0.8435
"Sure, both are pretty fast compared to a flying arrow or a galloping horse, but as we have seen, the speed of light is so great as to appear instantaneous in most situations.",0.9024
"It is surprising but true that all the rays like c really do converge on a point, forming a good image.",0.9072
"We will not prove this fact, but it is true for any mirror whose curvature is gentle enough and that is symmetric with respect to rotation about the perpendicular line passing through its center.",0.9136

Notation

M

a place where an object appears to be, because the rays diffusely reflected from any given point on the object have been bent so that they come back together and then spread out again from the new point like a real image, but the rays don’t actually cross again; they only appear to have come from the point on the image

the factor by which an image’s linear size is increased (or decreased) the factor by which an image’s apparent angular size is increased (or decreased)

describes a surface that is hollowed out like a cave describes a surface that bulges outward

the magnification of an image

the angular magnification of an image

Summary

A large class of optical devices, including lenses and flat and curved mirrors, operates by bending light rays to form an image.",0.936
"Also, heat conduction can only transfer heat energy from a hotter object to a colder one, but a cool fluorescent bulb is perfectly capable of heating something that had already started out being warmer than the bulb itself.",0.9477
